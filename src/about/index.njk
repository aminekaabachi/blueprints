<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hey there! I'm Amine Kaabachi, a solution architect at Databricks with a passion for helping organizations unlock the full potential of their data.</p>

<p>My journey in tech has been quite the evolution. I started as a full stack developer, building web applications and learning the fundamentals of software engineering. But I kept getting drawn to the data side of things — how it flowed through systems, how it was stored, and especially how it could be transformed into insights.</p>

<p>That curiosity led me into data engineering, where I spent years building pipelines, wrestling with ETL processes, and learning the hard way about distributed systems, data consistency, and the art of making trade-offs. From there, I evolved into data architecture, designing the bigger picture of how data systems should work together.</p>

<p>Now, as a solution architect at Databricks, I get to combine all of these experiences. I work with customers to design lakehouse architectures, solve complex data challenges, and help them navigate the modern data landscape. It's the perfect blend of technical depth and strategic thinking.</p>

<h2>What I'm Working On</h2>

<p>These days, I'm focused on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Designing lakehouse architectures that actually work in the real world</li>
  <li>Helping organizations modernize their data platforms</li>
  <li>Exploring the latest developments in unified analytics and AI</li>
  <li>Sharing lessons learned from my journey through different roles in the data world</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why "ThinkOnRead"?</h2>

<p>The name comes from the data engineering principle of "schema on read" — the idea that you don't need to define your data structure upfront. Instead, you apply structure when you actually need to use the data. I think this philosophy extends beyond just data schemas. The best insights often come from exploring and experimenting, not from perfect upfront planning.</p>

<p>This space is my way of thinking out loud about the challenges, solutions, and occasional victories I've encountered throughout my career progression. You'll find blog posts, project breakdowns, presentation slides, videos, and other resources. Whether you're a developer curious about data, an engineer looking to move into architecture, or an architect working with modern data platforms, I hope you'll find something useful here.</p>

<h2>Get in Touch</h2>

<p>I love connecting with fellow technologists at any stage of their data journey. Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss a post, share your own experiences, or just say hello!</p>
